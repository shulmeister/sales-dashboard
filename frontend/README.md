## Installation

To run this project locally, you will need the following tools installed on your computer:

- Make
- Node 22 LTS
- Docker (required by Supabase)

Fork the [`marmelab/atomic-crm`](https://github.com/marmelab/atomic-crm) repository to your user/organization, then clone it locally:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/[username]/atomic-crm.git
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
cd atomic-crm
make install
```

This will install the dependencies for the frontend and the backend, including a local Supabase instance.

Once your app is configured, start the app locally with the following command:

```sh
make start
```

This will start the Vite dev server for the frontend, the local Supabase instance for the API, and a Postgres database (thanks to Docker).

You can then access the app via [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/). You will be prompted to create the first user.

If you need debug the backend, you can access the following services: 

- Supabase dashboard: [http://localhost:54323/](http://localhost:54323/)
- REST API: [http://127.0.0.1:54321](http://127.0.0.1:54321)
- Attachments storage: [http://localhost:54323/project/default/storage/buckets/attachments](http://localhost:54323/project/default/storage/buckets/attachments)
- Inbucket email testing service: [http://localhost:54324/](http://localhost:54324/)

## Customizing Colorado CareAssist CRM

To customize the CRM, you will need TypeScript and React programming skills as
there is no graphical user interface for customization. Here are some resources
(from the original Atomic CRM project) to assist you in getting started.

2. [Creating Migrations](./doc/src/content/docs/developers/migrations.mdx) *(optional)*

## Testing Changes

This project contains unit tests. Run them with the following command:

```sh
make test
```

You can add your own unit tests powered by Jest anywhere in the `src` directory. The test files should be named `*.test.tsx` or `*.test.ts`.

## Registry

Atomic CRM components are published as a Shadcn Registry file:
- The `registry.json` file is automatically generated by the `bin/generate-registry.mjs` script as a pre-commit hook.
- The `http://marmelab.com/atomic-crm/r/atomic-crm.json` file is automatically published by the CI/CD pipeline

> [!WARNING]  
> If the `registry.json` misses some changes you made, you MUST update the `bin/generate-registry.mjs` to include those changes.

## Colorado CareAssist Extensions

The Colorado CareAssist deployment layers real-time communications on top of Atomic CRM while keeping the original UI intact.

### Beetexting SMS

- **Outbound:** The `beetexting-send-sms` Supabase Edge Function authenticates with Beetexting (client credentials + API key), sends texts via `/message/sendsms/{agentEmail}`, and logs a note on the contact timeline.
- **Inbound:** The `beetexting-webhook` Edge Function ingests Beetexting webhook events (contacts + inbound SMS) and stores them as notes, auto-creating contacts when needed.
- **Front-end:** Contacts now include a **Call** and **Send SMS** action; SMS goes through the edge function so the UI never hits Beetexting directly.
- **Per-user config:** In `Settings → Sales`, each rep now has `Beetexting Agent Email`. Populate this with the agent email defined in Beetexting’s API Connect page so their messages route through the correct mailbox.

Configure the Supabase project with:

```
npx supabase secrets set \
  BEETEXTING_CLIENT_ID=... \
  BEETEXTING_CLIENT_SECRET=... \
  BEETEXTING_API_KEY=... \
  BEETEXTING_FROM_NUMBER=+1XXXXXXXXXX \
  BEETEXTING_API_URL=https://connect.beetexting.com/prod \
  BEETEXTING_AUTH_URL=https://auth.beetexting.com/oauth2/token/ \
  BEETEXTING_WEBHOOK_SECRET=choose-a-random-string
```

Then run the migration + deploy the helper functions:

```
npx supabase db push --include-roles --password <SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD>
npx supabase functions deploy beetexting-send-sms beetexting-webhook ringcentral-webhook
```

Register a webhook subscription for each sales rep email (e.g. `jason@coloradocareassist.com`) using Betexting’s `POST /webhook/subscription/{agentEmail}`. Point the `uri` to your Supabase function URL (`https://<project>.functions.supabase.co/beetexting-webhook`) and send your shared `BEETEXTING_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in the `x-api-key` header when configuring Beetexting so every inbound SMS is logged.

### RingCentral Embeddable Workspace

The CRM now renders the same RingCentral widget used across the CareAssist portal so reps can call or text without leaving the dashboard. Add the following build-time variables (Heroku config vars or `.env.production.local`):

```
VITE_RINGCENTRAL_CLIENT_ID=<browser-app-client-id>
VITE_RINGCENTRAL_APP_SERVER=https://platform.ringcentral.com
VITE_RINGCENTRAL_APP_URL=https://apps.ringcentral.com/integration/ringcentral-embeddable/latest/app.html
VITE_RINGCENTRAL_ADAPTER_URL=https://apps.ringcentral.com/integration/ringcentral-embeddable/latest/adapter.js
VITE_RINGCENTRAL_REDIRECT_URI=https://cca-crm-cd555628f933.herokuapp.com/auth-callback.html
VITE_RINGCENTRAL_DEFAULT_TAB=messages
```

Once those values are present, the floating RingCentral pane appears automatically on desktop widths while preserving the original Atomic CRM layout.

To log calls coming from RingCentral:

- Fill the **RingCentral Extension** column for each sales user in `Settings → Sales`.
- Add a `?token=<RINGCENTRAL_WEBHOOK_TOKEN>` query string to your RingCentral subscription target and point it to `https://<project>.functions.supabase.co/ringcentral-webhook`.
- Subscribe to the `telephony/sessions` event stream inside the RingCentral Developer Console so every inbound/outbound call produces a contact note automatically.
