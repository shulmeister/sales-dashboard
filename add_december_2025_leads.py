"""
Utility script to capture the December 2025 incoming lead batch that
was provided out-of-band (portal downtime).

Run this against the production database (or any target DATABASE_URL)
to seed the three incoming leads plus their follow-up tasks.

Usage:
    export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
    python add_december_2025_leads.py

The script is idempotent: it updates existing leads with matching names
and only creates missing tasks.
